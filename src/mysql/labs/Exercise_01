 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Populate each table with at least 5 records.
 *
 *      6.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students

                SELECT * FROM students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)

                SELECT * FROM teachers WHERE subject like "computer science";

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

                SELECT * FROM students s
                JOIN teachers_students ts
                ON s.id = ts.id
                WHERE ts.teacher_id = 1;

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

                SELECT * FROM students s
                JOIN students_courses sc
                ON s.id = sc.id
                WHERE sc.course_id = 1;

 *          e. update a record in the student table

                UPDATE college.students SET last_name = "shafer" WHERE id = 5;

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table

                INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, email, age) VALUES ("Mira", "Adams", "madams@gmail.com", "4");
